# Sentiment AI - Simple Python Sentiment Analysis Tool

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that performs sentiment analysis using [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/). It's a simple AI-driven script that takes user input and classifies it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

## 🚀 Features

- Command-line interface for user input
- Sentiment classification using AI (TextBlob)
- Lightweight and easy to understand
- Fully open-source and beginner-friendly
- Git version-controlled for practice

## 🧠 How It Works

The script uses **TextBlob**, a popular NLP library, to analyze the polarity of text:

- `polarity > 0` → Positive
- `polarity < 0` → Negative
- `polarity = 0` → Neutral

## 🛠️ Installation
